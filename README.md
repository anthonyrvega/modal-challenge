Action Modal with Vite React and Dialog Tags
This repository contains an implementation of an Action Modal using Vite React and Dialog Tags. The Action Modal allows users to accept or reject a sale, and updates the state of the sale accordingly.

Why Vite React?
Vite is a build tool that provides a faster and more efficient development experience compared to traditional build tools like Webpack. It is designed to optimize the development experience by providing features like fast builds, hot module replacement, and an easy-to-use plugin system.

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture that allows developers to build complex UIs using simple, reusable components. React is widely used in the industry, and has a large ecosystem of libraries and tools.

Vite React is a template that provides a pre-configured development environment for building React applications with Vite. It includes the necessary plugins and configurations to enable fast development and optimized builds.

Why Dialog Tags?
Dialog Tags are a native HTML element that provides an easy way to create modal dialogs. Dialog tags are supported by all modern browsers, and provide a consistent and accessible way to implement modals without the need for complex JavaScript code. Dialog tags are easy to use and can be customized with CSS to match the style of the application.

Implementation
The Action Modal is implemented using Vite React and Dialog Tags. The ActionModal component renders a dialog with two buttons: "Accept" and "Reject". The handleAccept and handleReject functions are called when the user clicks on the corresponding button. These functions make a POST request to an API endpoint using the fetch function, and update the state of the sale accordingly.
